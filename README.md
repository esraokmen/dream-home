# Dream Home - Environment Art Project

## Project Overview
This project is designed for practicing environment art in Unity, focusing on creating my dream home. Through this project, I aim to enhance my skills in:

- **Stylized textures**
- **Organized file structure**
- **Cinematic lighting**
- **Camera movement**
- **Creating a short movie in Unity**

## Goals
1. Develop a visually appealing and immersive 3D environment.
2. Improve my proficiency in Unityâ€™s lighting and rendering pipeline.
3. Experiment with camera work to create compelling cinematic shots.
4. Maintain an industry-standard file organization structure.
5. Complete a short animated sequence showcasing the final environment.

## Tools & Software
- **Unity** (for environment setup and animation)
- **Blender/Maya** (for 3D modeling)
- **Substance Painter** (for texture creation)
- **Photoshop** (for additional texture detailing)
